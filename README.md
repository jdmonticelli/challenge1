# Bootcamp Challenge 1

## Refactoring Code

This week's assignment had us refactor and condense existing HTML and CSS to be more SEO friendly and semantic

- started with sample code
- refactored code
- created github repository
- cloned/pushed repo and made site live
- mission complete


## Installation

Download the repository and open index.html in a web browser. Read the comments in HTML and CSS files for details about my work. 

## Usage

Simply view the source code for refactoring details, and open index.html to visually confirm that the side still functions as intended, with the optimized code
